Intel Unison - Software application
"Great concept. But app needs to be running and on screen for it to work. Even if i just send the app to tray on pc, phone loses connection. Also there is no need to have a persistent notification telling me its running. Instead, there should be quick toggle like auto shazam which you can put on your navigation panel (top bar), with settings for wifi mobile data etc."
"Horrible connection stability! Following the developers comment to my review, I really wish the app could get fixed as fast as the developer aims to judge one’s competence by replying to negative reviews. Yes, my internet connection is stable, solid, and reliable. Yes, my phone and PC’s drivers are up to date. Connection stability is still horrendous and unusable! I’ve tried with multiple internet connections, cellular data, and combination of both 3 different computers. Still unusable!"
"This is a much better application than Microsoft's Link to Windows, but it's missing one glaring option, the ability to link the phone to multiple computers. This severely limits it when using both a desktop and a laptop. Please add this to the phone app ASAP!"
"very poor file transfer speed. My internet speed is 100 Mbps and I am connected to 5Ghz frequency. So I get a download speed of around 10mbps while downloading any file. Also my Bluetooth driver is updated and win 11 is having the latest version, also the app was downloaded today which is the latest version. But still the file transfer was very slow as compared to HP Quickdrop. I was using HP Quickdrop, but they are discontinuing their service from 30th may and they recommend to use Intel Unison"
Had to use this app since QuickDrop is coming to an end. 3 stars because the texting feature from QuickDrop isn't on Unison. That was really helpful for me and it sucks that it isn't a feature here. Also we need a dark mode feature. If those are given then guaranteed 5 stars.
"It's the one of the best app for cross platform sharing. But some of the features are missing such as multiple device addition is not supported (I can't add more than one Android phone) , DARK MODE is missing. Hoping to see this features in future updates."
"Almost the best app from Intel that I've used so far. I absolutely recommend to use that app. Transferring files work so fast. Of course this app better than ""Phone link"" because of this app have all features that ""Phone link"" have and also added one more feature that is exchange files between pc and phone"
"This app lacks the features of: 1) Display Extension/Second Screen with Phones. 2) Screen Mirroring. And the Most important one, 3) Keyboard or Mouse Share to Control your Phone with your PC's Keyboard or Mouse."
"i hope when hp quickdrop ends, this will be more reliable by features and performance. but now when i transferred a image from laptop to phone, it crashed twice and it also not showing transfer history between laptop and phone on phone app!! hope to see more improvements."
Since last security update it's impossible to transfer via USB so I'm forced to use this forsaken app. I have almost 2500 pictures and 150 videos on my phone and I can only transfer a few at a time. It's at least 10x slower than using USB. I'm not happy.
App can be great but the issue is like it always has to be running in background affecting my battery life. To fix this issue the pc and mobile will connect when the app's running on both devices if the app is in background it wont run while providing the background running feature
"I can't get it to make calls. It give me error: Intel Unison is not your default app for call handling. Open the PC application you currently use for calling, and disable call handling. I have disabled and turned off and disconnected Phone Link and still can not make calls using Unison."
"Wow! This app is top notch. Actually, the transfer of files work smoothly without the need for Bluetooth."
"Fast and convenient, easy to use, similar to Link To Windows but I use it only because of the file sharing feature."
instructions for transfer from mobile to computer are not very clear. user interface is a kind of Guess work.
It's worse idea to drop hp Quick drop it's UI design bwas in another level I loved it but unison does not have UI appealing to the uses just white all over ... what's that hell with the development ...looks matters a lot
"Extremely smooth, effortless transfer. easy-to-use interface, much better than other transferring apps"
Nice app and love to use but I want a setting in which I can select how many files I can send a time i.e. I want to send only 2 or 3 files a time and remaining in queue
Does not allow remote control of apps running on my phone thus it's not truly unifying my phone and PC at all.
"file transfer speed issues, slower than HP quickDrop. But data is not drop."
the connecting speed is a bit slow and the windows app doesn't have dark mode yet.
i can't believe how well it works for transferring files and photos over wifi with my s24 ultra. Samsung and Microsoft's craps just refuse to work together. This can do everything phone link can do plus much more.
"Great app! It just works! Unlike Link to Windows, which I've had trouble with, or Quick Share by both Google and Samsung, I've had no issues with this app! It just works straight up!"
"sometimes the data sharing is stuck in between and. when the file is send to pc ,pc shows 99% . I don't know why"
Amazing app ! It's smooth and reliable. Please add dark mode to both the desktop and the mobile app.
best app for connecting with your pc fast transfer speeds
"great, finnally a convenient solution for file transfer"
"So simple and easy to use, 0 issues, clean UI, fast upload times. 100x better than Phone Link on Windows."
everything is great. It would be great if you could add the function of opening the phone programs on the computer
Better than Quick Share or NearBy Share. Thank you Intel. ***((PHOTO / PHONE GALLERY needs to make private or switch off option.))
Overall superb! only a few tweaks to user experience and smoothness it's a great app very Happy using it!!! ??
"I've been a KDE Connect user for a long time. Intel Unison just changed the game by bringing the telephony feature to Windows. Giving it 3 stars because for the following bugs; 1. Sometimes mobile App won't connect to Desktop automatically, and needs app restart. 2. Their desktop app won't show Caller ID for incoming calls. Devs you can atleast match the phone number to synced contacts and show the ID. 3. Missing an option to submit Bugs or Feedback to developers. I hope they'll fix them soon."
"No support when using BT headset? Other than that it is a good application. This is the message I get:Bluetooth headset is connected to your PC. Intel Unison does not support calls while a Bluetooth headset is connected to your PC. Either connect the headset to your phone as well, or disconnect from your PC. Refresh"
"Great app. Easy to use, Perfect for qu'ici file transfer with no hassle, I strongly recommand"
"I can't even open it, I was trying to share stuff from my pc to my phone but the phone's app keeps crushing"
"As a starter, Product is stable and smooth. need to check for longer shares"
Thank you unison. Love you app. It works very smoothly and fast connection. Here is this for you ????????
Best app for ecosystem. No bugs. Just Dark mode necessary. Also color pallete support
Great app. File transfer works seamlessly. Uninstalled because my main use was sending sms from pc and the windows app has no option for me to choose which sim to use when sending texts or making calls
It is fast and reliable.
excellent upgrade from HP quick drop
App does not stay connceted even for 2 seconds it keeps on connecting and disconnecting
Good App for a good interaction between your Pc and your device
Great app for transfering files from any phones to my PC ??
Completely useless. Fails to reconnect to laptop on login despite trying every fix posted by other users trying to get this app to work. Even MS Phone Link is better.
"Zero Windows 10 support. Windows 11 on Intel Evo 13th Gen and above Processors, as in, Laptops with Intel Core Evo 13th Gen, or Core Evo 14th Gen EVO Certified CPUs only. Would be perfect, if they didn't support such a narrow consumer base. You can download this on virtually any modern phone or tablet, but the Windows application only supports a very narrow band of devices. Make it make sense Intel"
need faster file transfer rate....and need more features
This app has quite a bit more features that make it better that Phone Link
it's really good if I need to transfer photos/files to my my PC.
"This app came with a number of promises but just can not deliver. It couldn’t connect my phone with my pc. The app stops responding as soon as 'Connecting to Your PC"" page appears!"
"I have a suggestion, I installed this app on my window 11 pc, I set my pc to dark mode and all my apps are in dark mode except intel unison and there is no option in app itself to change it to dark mode if you guys provide dark mode would be easier on my eyes. Also on my pc when app running in background only, it takes up about 150 Mb of ram, is it normal?"
"Easy to install and setup devices. But what I don't like: on my laptop is showing the (share screen / mirroring feature) but not working yet. I saw the ,,coming soon,, text, but when will be available ? I really need it for my work flow."
"Bad.... Unfortunately. For some reason, I can't open the app. Eventide I try it just shuts down immediately.... Please help fix this. I have. A screen recording if you want"
The ability to send files from both ends is really handy. All that's left to reach KDE connect level would also be transferring the clipboard ??!!
"The team working on this app have greatly improved it since it first came out! Phone flawlessly now connects to my laptop, in a few seconds all my phone's contents are now loaded up on screen! Wonderful work!"
"Can't transfer files from pc to mobile, it say ""unsupported file extension, use file transfer"" when I am already in that section. It only works from mobile to PC."
data transfer not working
"Near instantaneous file sharing, Good looking UI on both devices, Faster connection speed compared to My Phone app (from Microsoft). Wouldn't hate to see Dark mode though."
Hopefully could be used for dual whatsapp messenger
"This app isn't as popular as it should be. It works perfectly with my Galaxy A24, and the file transfers are seamless."
Easy to use and efficient
"works really well, super fast file transfers and more reliable than Microsoft phone link"
Such Quick sharing i love it ??
"not liking now, very complicated and slow"
"I patiently awaited the availability of Shareit on Windows, and now that I have it, I'm quite pleased."
"Works wonders. This app should be a lot, A LOT more popular."
"Not for Windows 10, but for win 11 version 22H2, see that win version of known issues and notifications."
"It's good. But notifications are not in sync, they are delayed"
good for backup
Very intelligent app i love this app
Seamless for transferring files
Good+ app but connection problems
