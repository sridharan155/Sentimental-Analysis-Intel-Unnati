Intel Core I9-14900K LGA 1700 New Gaming Desktop Processor 24 Cores (8 P-Cores + 16 E-Cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked
Just upgraded from i5 9400f to i9 14900k and super happy with the performance that I am able to achieve. It simply works buttery smooth. Large applications open like notepad apps.
I don't liked the price of it .
I Also don't liked the performance of it .
Rather you can purchase i9 13th generation
13 gen is better with same performence at low pricing. Avoid this product cause it have only 2 core touching 6000 mhz so in real life there are no difference.
"Very good processor, but it needs good cooling."
Good decision for my computer
Not buying a cpu from this seller again wen my order came I opened the box and the cpu was not in the box even tho it still has the factory seal wast of almost 1k bucks
"Good processor that gives you the power to play games and do office work, video rendering, etc."
Fast processing.
Used for 3D rendering. Solid and fast. I am very happy with this cpu.
"There is almost no difference with the 13600K and it has been badly criticized, but since there is almost no difference in price, I think it's fine to choose either one."
"To the next generation One person found this helpful
"
"One of the best processors on the market. Excellent for any type of demanding task. But it's important to combine it with good liquid cooling or you'll have a thermal neck.
I had to order it twice because the first one had a very common hardware error in these processors, a problem in compiling shaders that crashes in some games or programs. The second one I ordered arrived without any problem."
"processor at the top, really amazing.Not cheap, but if you need performance this is the right processor."
"The performance is excellent, but the heat generation is also top class.
I'm running it with full-scale water cooling (30cm radiators*3 units), but even so, if it remains unlimited, the thermal throttling will hit a little bit.
It won't go 80 degrees at most according to the rating, but if it's unlimited, you can stabilize it by slightly manipulating the VF curve of the voltage.
Currently, it is easy to handle at 89? at maximum.
However, considering the electricity bill, I honestly don't think it's a good one in terms of cost performance.
The speed of encoding etc. has increased enough by that amount, but the electricity bill...
I am satisfied with the best performance."
"The game falls according to its reputation. However, the problem can be solved by making proper BIOS and graphics settings, but at least it is not for first-time teaming up. If you still want one, study the settings carefully."
I really don't recommend buying these precision instruments on Amazon.
"I tried applying the power limit at 160w with simple water cooling on Cooler Master , but when I play a video with the cursor over the thumbnail on YouTube, the temperature suddenly rises, and the temperature is stable for normal playback."
"This is something that a lot of people do not understand about processors. If you put too much voltage you are going to damage it. I want to delid it but I don't see the need and here is why
Even if I can get it 20 degrees cooler it will not matter It will still need 3.5 to 4.2 volts to stay stable at advertised speeds."

"I really liked it, without demeriting the AMD competition who are doing great as well. But in my case, since DDR5 memories are optimized for Intel and I don't want to be fighting, I decided on this one and I don't regret my purchase. Very good premium quality product."
"The noticeable increase in performance that I've experienced is remarkable and shows the advancements in technology.
"
"The combination provides a solid basis for demanding tasks and gaming.
However, it should be noted that the exact performance may vary depending on the applicatio"
"he combination with the Asus Apex Encore and the fast 7200 MHz RAM delivers great results, after all, I was able to achieve 41,000 points in Cinebench R23 without overclocking."
"Applications open u p much faster too, but that could be more due to the pcie4.0 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme I had in the old build."
"The one thing I do not like about the new cpu, is the number of pci lanes. You only get 20, 16 are pcie5.0 and 4 are pcie4.0. This wont be an issue for most people, but my old cpu had 40 lanes, allowing me to run 3 GPU's at the same time, and YES, I needed them, I use GPU rendering software that can use up to 8 GPU's in one system on one license and every additional GPU speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3D sims."
"It is not a deal breaker, and the increased speed overall is well worth it"
"Keep it simple!
I am satisfied with the performance and stability."
Too expensive value for money
I can't feel a difference in performance from the 13th generation
"you take the i9 model with K into consideration, there is no such difference in performance even on benches, so the same 13th generation one may have better cost performance."
The product arrived earlier than expected and in good condition. Which is very much appreciated. I will be testing in the next few days
"It arrived in perfect condition, the processor had written exactly what I ordered: i9 14900KF. It arrived quickly and well packed."
Very good service
Everything ok again thank you
t's a monster of a CPU genuinely and if you are in the market for an upgrade don't hesitate you won't regret it.
"This processor has way better memory controller then my previews 12900k for my DDR4 clocking at 3950 MHz at 15-15-15-30 timing error free. I had heard about the 14900k has crashing issues so far I have no issues with Unreal Engine 5 games, Tekken 8, Battlefield 2042, etc, et"
Even running at the default 6.1ghz turbo settings the processor is extremely unstable and causes constant crashing.
"It's a processor. It's like any other processor that processes, only better."
It destroys video editing and processor intensive brush strokes in Corel Painter. It has no problem with any kind of processing you can throw at it.
"Runs hot and causes the cooler to spool up when playing poorly programmed games, but the water cooler is up to the task. Still, it reveals what games are just piles of trash code."
"I bought this as an upgrade from my trusty i9 10900k. I was worried the performance boost would be marginal but I was pleasantly surprised to get a solid boost on 1440p with my rtx 4080 super. Playing Helldivers 2, my fps went from mid 70s-90s to 120-140s at everything maxed out."
"I can't tell you the frustration this caused figuring this out. Everything from chrome browsers to Adobe CS would crash randomly for no apparent reason every few minutes while all ""tests"" showed it was fine. I lowered my refresh rate to 60 from 120, killed AI overclocking and set the INTEL setting and now have a very stable system."
"basically useless for me at this point and don't see myself doing it manually as it's just not worth it to me. That said, when stable, it's a very capable chip."
It was easy for him to install. It performs fantastic.
I upgraded from an i9 - 11900K. Pretty good performance increase on benchmarks. I haven't gamed on it yet (still in the process of locking down cables and loose hardware)
Able to compile rust code way faster now.
"Once they came down in price, I did get a i9-14900K as an ""upgrade"" from a i9-13900KF to i9-14900K . It's OK but I can't rave over it. It is more of an sideways change rather than an upgrade."
"I did NOT notice a significant improvement in the operating temperatures. Maybe a slight improvement but I did flush out the cooling system and clean out the water block so I am doubtful that the running temps are better. Also, I suggest that you NOT let these chips get anywhere near TjMax (100C). I had one i9-13900KF literally fail due to allowing it to get to TjMax frequently when stress testing. A second one became slightly flaky."
Ooohhhhh boy this is fast and secksy. Maybe the women will love me long time for buying mmmmmm boy Im insecure
Like the idea of no onboard video heating up the processor. The irony is i have a Asus pro art MB 750 model that does the integration of components. My station is primarily used as a work station though it scores well with PC Mark 10 and cinebench. 3D Mark declares the obvious that I need to upgrade my video card from several years ago.
This CPU is a absolute monster. Period. i love it . i have it paired with a 4080 super. Any new game i can usually pull 300 fps on any game!
"I had some issues after install with Windows wanting me to buy it over again. While I was on with Microsoft tech support even they were like, ""that's a heck of a setup""..."
"The processor is great and arrived sealed in good condition, however, the cardboard box had no protection and it could easily be damaged if it fell."
"I previously purchased the 13th Gen version of this processor and it had a defect. Intel was very good at getting a refund sent via RMA, although it took awhile. I purchased this version instead and was pleasantly surprised to see all of my issues resolved. The CPU can handle almost everything thrown at it. Certainly a good purchase and better than the 13th gens that seem to have more issues."
"Words truly cannot express how powerful, but also how hot this cpu is. "
"The only con which isn't truly a con is that this chip can get incredibly HOT. If you're going to get this? I would absolutely suggest a 360 AIO cooler or you're going to experience thermal throttling, or even thermal shutdowns. That was my original issue, but quickly upgraded coolers, and this thing is a MONSTER."
"So far so good. This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset. I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltasI have used this for my build and 3 others, didn't realize what the F is for...Get the K, it's not much more and worth the extra. That being said, this beast will do everything you want it to do and more."
"I have used this for my build and 3 others, didn't realize what the F is for...Get the K, it's not much more and worth the extra. That being said, this beast will do everything you want it to do and more."
"This CPU is POWERFUL! It ran smoother and was able to open/load programs much faster than my Ryzen 7 5700G. Had no issues cooling this beast of a CPU with a 280mm AiO. If money wasn’t an issue for me, I would definitely buy another 14900K just to keep as a little souvenir hahaha."
"A lot of people are upset with the 14900k because of the minimal performance leap thar came between it and the 13900k. I say who cares. If you have a 13900k, don't upgrade, but if you have an older PC or 12th Gen, this is a worthy upgrade. I absolutely love mine. It's a monster of a CPU."
"I honestly don't recommend air cooling it. It can get pretty hot and there are only a small handful of air coolers that can handle this 14900k without setting power limits (which most people don't know how to do, let alone even know what that means)"
"This CPU draws a ton of power so you might see it bump up to 80? occasionally, for a very brief moment. (Maybe 1 second or less)"
"I'm definitely gonna upgrade later but this is handling itself pretty well with dragon dogma 2 to fortnite and everything in-between, only gripe is that there's no small arrow on the actual CPU to indicate where to place it on motherboard so if you tossed the packaging without looking you might be bit confused with orientation otherwise good."
I'm actually losing performance with this model version. I'll have to return the item to purchase the correct version without an F. I would give it a full 5 stars if it had the line explaining the F version.
i like it
There's currently an issue that causes them to be set to insanely high values (4096W) by default causing the chip to become unstable under heavy loads.
For the purchase of the processor I said that they were giving away a game I don't see any exchange code for the rest Intel is Intel the best on the market
"No more lining up pins, now you just make sure this thing sits in the way it belongs and off you go! I've had an H170i on it the whole time but it barely gets into the 40's when under extreme load. For the price, the 14700KF is the way to go imho"
It doesn't get too hot but I use a 360 Corsair radiator
"Didn't get to use this because the motherboard I ordered with it was D.O.A. Not the seller's fault, of course. I ended up refunding."
Must have 360mm water cooler for this cpu it runs very hot fast! My 260mm wasn’t enough to cool it down at all while gaming!
"New, great product, came as described and very fast at the same day!"
As a Gamer/Data Scientist/Programmer/Tinker I wanted a mainstream CPU built by a well established company. With Intel's i9-14900K CPU I have a top of the line general purpose chip which provides above average performance in all the computational fields I have an interest in. I only gave it a 4-star rating because I had hoped that Intel would have brought the 15th generation chips out in 2023 Q4 as they said rather than just the mobile chips.
Excellent super fast processor I recommend it to everyone who wants to upgrade their computer or build a new one I use it with the 4080 video card super excellent combination.
"My benchmark is almost at 14k now with without overclocking.

nVidia GTX 1080, 65gb 6400 ram and 2gb PCIE5 SSD, Gigabyte Z790 Elite x wifi7 motherboard.
I won't need to change this setup for the next decade or so like I did with my last PC.

Worth the money, but you'll need the right SSD to go with it."
I am so glad I decided to take the chance because this thing screams. To think that I can also squeeze out more by overclocking is just insane.
"Every application I've ran is so snappy and responsive. Being an impatient human, this thing makes me happier every time I turn it on. Power and Speed are right where I like it. This chip is just so damn sweet!"
"his is an excellent, stable CPU. Care must be taken to keep it cool. It is a hot running CPU. To avoid heat throttling at 100deg Celsius in heavy duty gaming or testing, order a high end liquid cooler. F"
"For professional work and easy gaming a big block fan cooler will be just fine as it is much more quiet. To save a little money, if at all, the I9-13900K will work just as well performance wise."
I love it.
Works - what else is needed? a little expensive.
"Even you're getting hotter temps despite having great cooling, it's normal for this CPU. It's a beast. I recommend using a triple-fan-radiator AIO cooler to keep this bad boy as cool as possible. And make sure to blow the hot air OUT of your PC case."
Not sure what more to say other than it's crazy powerful. Make sure you have a high watt power supply to go with this and all the devices you plan to run with this. And really don't go small on the CPU cooler. This thing is good at figuring out when to throttle down.
"You'll get it's best performance with a large aio water cooler. If you can build your own water cooling system, better."
"I built PC with the new Intel i9-14900k, and I must say, it's a beast of a processor. Coming from an i7-8700k, the performance boost is nothing short of incredible. Multitasking, gaming, and content creation have all seen a significant improvement"
"great cpu, not as powerful as I thought it would be. Ended up going with a 14700k, just seemed a bit laggy even when running at 5.8 all core.. great cpu though and runs cool"
"Amazing performance. But you should definitely use water cooling, with a processor fan, you run the risk of the processor throttling due to overheating."
"May be a little excessive and unnecessary, but glad I got one when I did. Sometimes these things get hard to acquire, especially at a decent price."
"Seems to run a little hotter than my Ryzen 9 7950X, so I went with dual 420mm, If you buy this CPU you should really consider custom loops or large cases with 420mm AIO support."
"The i9 14900K is undoubtedly a very powerful CPU!
Just for gaming I wouldn't recommend, for gaming and working, YES!
Also, think about a GOOD COOLING solution (custom watercooler, cryo,...) and/or undervolting (depends on MoBo).
A regular 360mm AIO has a hard time keeping this CPU cool!"
"The Intel i9-14900K delivers impressive performance with its high clock speeds and advanced architecture. It excels in demanding tasks like gaming, content creation, and multitasking, offering smooth and responsive performance."
"Overall, it's a top choice for enthusiasts and power users seeking uncompromising performance."
"No issues with this seller or product, but for those that are looking for a new PC part the 14900 k is merely a refinement over the 13900k which you may be able to find cheaper."
"This beauty does exactly what it says, super fast overclocking her to 6 GHz run smooth."
"INTEL is saying it's the motherboard, and the motherboard is saying it's INTEL. we are not getting what we paid for, I think they should recall and give us a refund ?? what a waste."
"I totally rebuilt my computer with a Asus Rog 790Z board, 5 M.2 drives. I get a total boot up in 15 Seconds. I use the unit for Data, Video and music. I've used intel chips and Asus Boards for over 30 years and never had a problem. With this package I get instant access to all my files. Very happy with my purchase."
"The i7 14700KF isn't just a CPU; it's a beast unleashed. This 20-core powerhouse purrs like a kitten under normal workloads, staying surprisingly cool thanks to its 7nm architecture."
"don't be fooled by its initial demeanor this CPU is a wolf in sheep's clothing, ready to tear through any demanding games and content creation tasks with ease, I paired with an rx 7900 xtx and forgot about frame rate drops and stuttering."
"I had a minor hiccup with my new 14900KF, but I contacted Intel and their customer service was fantastic. They sent me a new one and it's working great now."
 I have a negative offset on the voltage of -0.0500v and the hottest I've seen it get was 62c while playing Horizon Zero Dawn maxed at 4K. It was getting as high as 190 FPS every now and then. This CPU is brutal man. Top flight customer service too.
"Decided to go Intel over AMD and this cpu will not disappoint you. I’d recommend looking into the E-Core and Pcore information before you buy, haven’t noticed any issue with it but still a nuisance"
"PERFECT! EASIER to install than I thought as a first time processor install for me.
WORTH WHILE performance increase from my (also good 12700). And helped unleash the power of my 4090oc GPU."
"I think I finally lost the silicon lottery. Using an Asus mb, I had to go into bios limit voltage and manually tune each pcore. Temps were wild and out of control 100°c, clock speeds were low thermal throttling, random crashes, blue screens inability to run simple programs without them crashing and shutting down. Tried intel xtu auto overclocking, ai suite, and asus ai overclocking via bios.. none of that worked. Had to just dig into bios, set limits, and manually tune each core. Now system is stable and solid. Been benchmarking and stress testing for a few days now. Temps are great, and I am happy."
"Perfect, it's an i9 you can't say more"
"This CPU is amazing. Feels like magic. I have it running in an Asrock PG Sonic 700 series, with 32GB GSkill DDR5 7200, and a Crucial T700 2TB PCIe 5.0 SSD and Cooler Master Masterliquid Atmos 360. Anytime u do anything, even click a icon the cpu jump up to 6Ghz."
"feel like it runs cooler then the 13900K, the 13900K was the hot chip. I don't know how they do it. Like I said it's like magic how it stays at 6GHz and stays so cool."
upgraded from a 12600kf and 3080 10gb and went to this 14700kf and 4070 ti super and its great. added 60-70fps on a lot of games.
Currently playing Battlefield 2042 with this beast and it’s silk smooth even paired with a 1080ti
